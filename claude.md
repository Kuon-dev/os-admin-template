# Admin Dashboard - Claude Instructions

## Project Overview

This is a **dummy project** created for demonstration and learning purposes.

## Important Notes

- **No API Integration Required**: This project uses mock data and does not require any backend API integration or real API calls.
- All data displayed in the dashboard is static or generated mock data.
- Focus on UI/UX implementation and frontend functionality rather than backend connectivity.

## Development Guidelines

When working on this project:
- Use mock/dummy data for all components
- Do not attempt to integrate with real APIs or backend services
- Keep the focus on creating a clean, functional UI with Next.js, React, and TypeScript
- Feel free to use placeholder data or local state management for interactive features
